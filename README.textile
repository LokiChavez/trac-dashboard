h2. Trac Developer Dashboard

My hope is to create a developer dashboard filled with small reports that the developer can look at to track their time and plan their day.

So far, the follow reports are being generated (x = 14):

   * New tickets in the last x days
   * Updated in the last x days
   * To Do in the last x days
   * Status Changes in the last x days
   * Milestone Bar Charts
